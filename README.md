# WiiFit-Fitness-Tracker
This was a project I made in ENGR 7B at UCI during the 2024 Winter Quarter. I led
an Engineering team of 5 people to design and fabricate a device that counted steps and flights
climbed, and displayed the results on an app. Our budget was $50.

We used an Arduino Wemos board, connected to an accelerometer and barometer for the measurments.
We also took user input from a button, and displayed our results on an OLED display along with a
piezo buzzer.

My main focus in the project was the C++ programing. I wrote all of the logic for the team,
including input from sensors, output to devices and the app, calculation of steps and flights,
calculating the steady state of the accelerometer, and more.
